<p>90% of people are switching to multiple screens to browse the internet! So, to target all your potential clients it's important to have a website that is optimized for all devices. Responsive websites have a single URL and HTML code which gets optimized according to the screen resolution on which it is opened thus giving an optimum viewing experience. Responsive web design provides solutions by making websites and applications smart enough to resize and adapt its content based on the screen size of the device.</p>
<p>Today, Google is working on building a mobile-only index, meaning if your business's website is not mobile-friendly you may not appear in mobile search results at all. Once released, Google's mobile index will be the primary search index the search engine uses to respond to queries.</p>
